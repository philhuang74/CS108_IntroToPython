#1. Gives the numeric part (Temperature) of the sentence
sentence = "The temperature today is going to be around >100 degrees F"
number_part = sentence[45:48]
print("The temperature is:", number_part, "degrees Fahrenheit")

#2. Gives the index number of the first "d" in sentence
sentence = "The temperature today is going to be around >100 degrees F"
d_sentence = sentence.find("d")
print("The index number of the first d found in sentence is", d_sentence)
#The string method find gives the index number of the first time string "d" is found in the sentence

#3. Describes what the optional arguments in find method achieves
#The optional arguments in the find method are start and end ,and they represent
#the index number where you can start and end (interval or range) to find the specific string object in the entire string.

#4. Tells the index number range of temperature
sentence = "The temperature today is going to be around >100 degrees F"
index = sentence.find(">")
temp_index = index+1
index_2 = sentence.find(" degrees")
print("The index number of temperature is", temp_index, "to", index_2)

#5. (a) Decides if sentence is Pallindrome
#Pseudocode: 
#Need to check the first and last letters
#Then the letter to the left moves up by one and the one on the right moves down
#Repeat this until the right is not greater than the left, then the check should stop
#if all left letter and right letter is same to this point, then it is Pallindrome
#For part b, just have to get rid of all the punctuations and spaces, and follow the same as (a)

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
left = 0
right = len(sentence)-1
while sentence[left] == sentence[right] and right > left:
    left +=1
    right -=1
if sentence[left] == sentence[right]:
    print("Yes, this is Pallindrome")
else:
    print("No, not a Pallindrome")

#5. (b)
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
sentence = sentence.replace(" ","")
sentence = sentence.replace(",","")
sentence = sentence.replace(".","")
sentence = sentence.replace("'","")
sentence = sentence.replace("!","")
sentence = sentence.lower()

left = 0
right = len(sentence)-1
while sentence[left] == sentence[right] and right > left:
    left +=1
    right -=1
if sentence[left] == sentence[right]:
    print("Yes, this is Pallindrome")
else:
    print("No, not a Pallindrome")

footyText = "Football refers to a number of sports that involve kicking a ball \
with the foot to score a goal. The most popular of these sports worldwide is \
association football, more commonly known as just 'football' or 'soccer'. \
Unqualified, the word football applies to whichever form of football is the \
most popular in the regional context in which the word appears, including \
association football, as well as American football, Australian rules football, \
Canadian football, Gaelic football, rugby league, rugby union, and other \
related games. These variations of football are known as football codes.Various \
forms of football can be identified in history, often as popular peasant games. \
Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these \
games at English public schools in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The \
influence and power of the British Empire allowed these rules \
of football to spread to areas of British influence outside of the directly \
controlled Empire, though by the end of the nineteenth century, distinct \
regional codes were already developing: Gaelic Football, for example, \
deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in \
order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in \
England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During \
the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become \
among the most popular team sports in the world."

#Pseudocode
#Need to make sure footytext does not have punctuation and uppercases before using split
#Then need to find the number of words, which can be done by counting the number of things in the split footy text variable
#To find the times football shows up, this can be done if thing is equal to football in the for loop

#####The split function seems to make a list of the words in footyText as strings

count = 0
for thing in split_footyText:
    print(thing)
    count+=1
print("The number of words is:", count)

###Instead of single characters being printed out one by one, it prints out each word one by one

count = 0 
for thing in split_footyText:
    if thing == "football":
        count+=1
print("Football shows up", count, "times")
